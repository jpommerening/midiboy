# About the ATtiny2313a

The [ATtiny2313a](http://www.atmel.com/devices/attiny2313a.aspx) is small
microcontroller made by Atmel. It is available in various packages. For this
project we're using the PDIP-20 package, which at approx. 1 by Â¼ inch is a bit
larger than the alternatives and allows through-hole soldering.

The ATtiny2313a has 2KB of flash memory as well as 128B (yes, bytes) of EEPROM
and RAM each. Driven by an external oscillator it can operate at up to 20MHz.
